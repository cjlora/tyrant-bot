TYRANT Discord bot

This is a bot can mute and unmute everyone in a voice channel through voice commands.

Thank you to zahid47 for letting me understand how his MuteAll bot works. I took inspiration from his work and converted some of the commands to NodeJs

I also used Rei-x's speech recognition extension for discord js
